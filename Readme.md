Goals: 

- collect your stats, including match history
- collect stats for people you follow
- allow easy export of the data as csv or json
- apparently there's a GGST API as well, would be great to have support for that
- is there some way to get GBFVR stats?
- more stuff?

PS - This is my first chrome extension and I am learning TypeScript while writing it
